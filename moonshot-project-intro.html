    <p>Man, it's ups and downs all week. I'm mentally doing well but struggling physically today. Happily, I've stuck with <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a> and gotten another day done.</p>
<p>I'd only just started exploring <code>GeometryReader</code> in my generative art experiments recently, so it was nice to see it introduced in 100 Days of SwiftUI today. I guess we have to wait a few weeks to cover it in detail. SwiftUI's <code>ScrollView</code> was new-ish to me as of last week. Only yesterday I started using it in my iNat SwiftUI prototype, so it was nice to get a proper introduction. Meanwhile, the other two main topics covered, <code>NavigationLink</code> and hierarchical <code>Codable</code> data, were not really new at all for me.</p>
<p>I have a bit of an intro for my <a href="https://github.com/alexshepard/generativeart">Generative Art</a> work. Off and on, over the last year, I've been teaching myself to make digitial art and doing digital drawing using some popular tech art frameworks like Processing and P5.js. I briefly tried doing it with Swift a few years ago, but making art out of UIKit view hierarchies was limiting (especially on an iPad in Swift Playgrounds). Happily, SwiftUI comes to the rescue. The new <code>Canvas</code> view type in the beta version of SwiftUI is great for doing dynamic drawing, and it can take hints about the screen size if wrapped in a <code>GeometryReader</code>. After that, all that I needed to do was draw into the <code>Canvas</code> to make a digital drawing, and I was even able to animate my drawing using a <code>Timer</code> that was attached to the View hierarchy using the <code>.onReceive()</code> modifier. Next steps will be to go back and re-implement some of my favorite Processing and P5.js sketches in Swift using this little framework I've spun up.</p>
