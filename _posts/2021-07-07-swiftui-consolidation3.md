I'm kind of in a mental fog today, too many meetings and not enough actual coding lately. But I did find a little time for [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

I was encouraged to read Paul's mention of the cognitive speed bump when transitioning from imperative to declarative UI programming. He specifically called out animations with SwiftUI as being tough for experienced UIKit programmers to get their head around, and that was exactly my experience with the challenges yesterday. I'm happy to see that my struggles so far haven't been unexpected - I just have to stick with this.

As for today's challenge, working through a Multiplication Table game, I got the basics working. My UI is pretty clunky, but I worked throught the entire core challenge in about an hour. Feels good, man.
