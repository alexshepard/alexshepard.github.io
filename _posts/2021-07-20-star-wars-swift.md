I got another chunk of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) done today. I also started putting together the parts for the new iNat computer vision training server. It posted on the first try!

No coding today for 100 Days of SwiftUI, just [a video](https://vimeo.com/295238750) to watch. Some of it was a great reminder to pay more attention to the engineering side of software development, not just chasing fads or copying / reimplementing code from stack overflow without thinking about it. I know I've been guilty of this. The section on community and diversity within the Swift core team was also well said and worth a listen.

Finally, I'm done with the Color chapter in the [Generative Design](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/) book. On to Shape!
