I haven't been feeling well enough today to be productive in other parts of my life, but at least I got some work done on [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

Nothing really exciting in Core Data & SwiftUI today - basically just extending a few things we'd already learned in ways that weren't too challenging for me. Using an enum with raw values for the predicate parameter was a nice little bit, definitely the kinds of things that I've needed to do at work.

Nothing much to report on the Generative Art stuff, today's sketch was an iteration on the one from yesterday.
