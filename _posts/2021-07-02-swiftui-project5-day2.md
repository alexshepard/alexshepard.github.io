One more day of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) on the books.

Still not much new in terms of SwiftUI features. I liked the pattern of `guard` and simple functions returning booleans as validation for the text input. It was definitely cleaner than stuffing the error alert creation into the validation functions.

I also hadn't seen the `onCommit:` parameter of `TextField` before, nice to know about that.
