Since May I’ve been reading and following along with Joel Grus’ _Data Science From Scratch_. One of the first things we learn in this book is how to make charts in Python with matplotlib.

I’ve also been reading the _Wall Street Journal_ daily and _The Economist_ weekly. As you may know, both of these publications are chock full of charts and graphs.

Wouldn’t it be fun to re-make some of the graphs from these publications from scratch? Of course it would, if you like banging your head against API servers and fiddling with graph designs.
