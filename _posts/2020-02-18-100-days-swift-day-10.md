Late day of [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) today, too much work and other stuff to do. I'll just do a short blog post.

I didn't realize that `super.init()` is always required in the `init` method of subclasses. Probably healthy, it's part of the Objective-C boilerplate.

Also, I've noticed some patterns in what kinds of Paul's questions are true or false, based on the subject matter. Maybe I'll make a classifier? ;)
