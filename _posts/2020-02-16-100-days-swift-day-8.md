I'm done with a full week of [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100)! For some reason, structs make me happy. I just like them. They were exotic and cool when I was learning C to hack on the Linux kernel. They're still cool today, now that value types and immutability are the hotness.

Two things to cover: property observers and mutating methods. Property observers are kinda like KVO, giving you a convenient place to do something when a property will be or was set. The `mutating` keyword lets you safely mark which methods can change properties inside the struct, the implication being that these `mutating` methods will only be callable on variable instances of the struct.

```swift
struct Observation {
	var taxon: Taxon
}

struct Taxon {
	var commonName: String
	var scientificName: String
	var seenCount: Int {
		didSet {
			print("Another lovely \(commonName)!")
		}
	}
	
	mutating func createObservation() -> Observation {
		seenCount += 1
		return Observation(taxon: self)
	}
}
```

No annoyances today! ^_^
