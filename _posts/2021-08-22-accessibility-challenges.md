Another day of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) wrapped up today. I'm at day 75, and I'm already starting to think about what to work on next. I'm trying to decide between Tensorflow, SpriteKit & Metal, or maybe ARKit. I suppose I need to learn all 3 to get where I'm going, so I should just pick one and dive in. I'll get the most mileage for work out of a Tensorflow challenge, but I think I'll get the furthest drawing-wise out of a SpriteKit & Metal one.

The accessibility challenges were pretty simple today, except that the Xcode Beta has clobbered accessibility labels and values for `Stepper`. I continue to be a little baffled by Paul saying "accessibility works best if it's baked in from the beginning and not an afterthought," but then teaching accessibility in a section where we go back and add accessibility to prior projects, which is the definition of afterthought.

Today's image is from yet another moire sketch, from the [Generative Design book](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/). This time adding blend modes to make it more interesting.
