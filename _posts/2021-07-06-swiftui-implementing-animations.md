I got a little more [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) done today.

The challenges today were the hardest for me yet in this 100 Days of SwiftUI thing. Not technically hard, more in terms of how to think about adding animation to a view or transition. I've gotten comfortable thinking about how to add UI and even stateful UI to an app using declarative syntax, but I'm not as comfortable thinking about how to animation in a natural way. I guess I just need more experience.
