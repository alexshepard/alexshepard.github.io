It’s been about a week since I’ve posted. I’ve managed to mostly stay on top of my [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) work but I have to be honest. I’ve been too drained from family stuff to deal with blogging. Sometimes life just sucks.

I’ve not got a ton to report, I’ve learned a bunch about interfacing between MapKit and SwiftUI yesterday and today, and hopefully I can bring that to bear on my iNat work.

Here's a sketch adapted from the [Generative Design book](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/). In the book, they used HTML checkboxes to draw simple images. Here, I'm using the camera to turn SwiftUI `Toggle` views on and off.
