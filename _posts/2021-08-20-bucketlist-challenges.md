Trying to pull myself together for another [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) this afternoon. Nothing much exciting, just a few challenges.

More from the [Generative Design book](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/) today. Another moire sketch, this time with overlapping rects of parallel lines.
