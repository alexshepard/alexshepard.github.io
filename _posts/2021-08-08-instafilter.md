Another day of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) wrapped up today. It was a pretty easy day today, we used what we learned the past few days to get the Instafilter app UI and basic functionality working. 

Here's a sketch from the [Generative Design book](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/). More rotating rects, this time with a gradient.
