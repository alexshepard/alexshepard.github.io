Welp, another day of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) finished. Today was a rough day, hours of meetings. Some of them were important, but it was still exhausting.

Nothing at all new when building the UI for the Cupcake app, so it was a nice easy day there. Meanwhile I did a new sketch for my [Generative Art](https://github.com/alexshepard/generativeart) work, porting the sketch titled "Alignment in a grid" in the [Generative Design](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/) to SwiftUI.
