I got nothing done for [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) the past few days, because I was attending [Hacking with Swift: Live!](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/live) all week. Tons of coverage of the new concurrency stuff in Swift 5.5, and a great community. It was a wonderful event, and it was nice to have a few days away from the grind of work.

Here's a sketch I've been doodling with on my spare time this week - playing with effects on the luminosity of pixels from the camera.
