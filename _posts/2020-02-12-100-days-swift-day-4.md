I'm stuck in a loop, doing day 4 of [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) again.

Only two short comments today. 

First, I'd forgotten about repeat loops. Does anyone really use them?

```swift
repeat {
	print("The body of a repeat loop is always executed at least once.")
	break
} while true
```

Second, I also forgot about named loops and exiting multiple loops.

```swift
def getPixel(x: Int, y: Int) -> UIColor {
	// ... some implementation
}

columns: for i in 0...1125 {
	for j in 0...2436 {
		if getPixel(x: i, y: j) == .white {
			print("found the white pixel")
			break columns
		}
	}
}
	
```

Today, a Ulysses for iPad annoyance: why does Ulysses try to auto-capitalize text in a code block?
