Back into blogging! I'm starting up [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) again, picking up where I'd previously left off.

I've already shipped one app built in SwiftUI, but it's a really simple app with no networking or state. After WWDC this year, I got inspired and found that I wanted to get back into SwiftUI seriously, perhaps with an eye to re-writing the iNat app in SwiftUI in the next year or two.

Today was just exploring some basic forms and layout options in SwiftUI. Nothing really new, but fun to get back into the swing of things. Also today was resurrecting this blog, with all the ruby/jekyll shenanigans that required.
