Another slow day with a bit of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) work. I also went to the dentist today and that sucked, so there's that.

Meanwhile I'm working on this flag guessing app. 

Nothing truly new this time around, only casual / inconsequential feedback about clipping a country flag inside a Capsule clipshape. I thought it looked generally OK for simple and symmetrical flags like the European ones that Paul chose as his example, but it works less well for asymmetrical flags such as New Zealand, South Korea, Oman, China, etc. Still a great example for learning how to clip an image (or I guess any other View) to a shape!
