Another day of [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) in the books! Today I finished the section on structs. I'd forgotten a few things, so let's dive in.

In Objective-C, we typically implement lazy variables by making them computed properties, so I'm not used to thinking about these concepts separately. However, here's an attempt at a contrived example that includes both lazy variables and computed properties:

```swift
struct BaseData {
    var records: [String]
    
    init(from json: String) {
        let data = NSData(contentsOfFile: json)!
        let jsonArray = try! JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data as Data, options: .fragmentsAllowed)
        self.records = jsonArray as! [String]
    }
    
    var testTrainSplit: Int {
        return Int(Double(records.count) * 0.8)
    }
    
    var trainSet: ArraySlice<String> {
        return self.records.prefix(self.testTrainSplit)
    }
    
    var testSet: ArraySlice<String> {
        return self.records.suffix(from: self.testTrainSplit)
    }
}

struct TitanicDataset {
    lazy var data = BaseData(from: "titanic.json")
    
    // must be mutable because we're accessing a lazy variable
    mutating func train() {
        for record in self.data.trainSet {
            // train or something
        }
    }
}
```

Note that you can't use lazy variables on constant `let` instances of a struct. If you think about it for a minute, it'll make sense. Accessing the lazy property causes the instance to be modified when the property is finally initialized and assigned, and that's not allowed. This is also why the `train()` method of `TitanicDataset` has to be marked as `mutating`.
