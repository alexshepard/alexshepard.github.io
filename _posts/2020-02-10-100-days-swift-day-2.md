Yay, on to day 2 of [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100)!

I'd forgotten that dictionary literals in Swift are written with square brackets, instead of with curly braces like pretty much every other language that I've used.

```swift
var languages = [
	"Alex": ["English", "Italian", "Japanese"],
	"Skyler": ["English", "German", "Latin"],
	"Hal": ["English", "German"],
]
```

I'd also forgotten the syntax for using a default value when fetching from a dictionary. This seems awkward to me, Python's `defaultdict` seems more helpful to me, where the default is stored on the dictionary instead of being specified each time lookup is performed.

```swift
languages["Wally", default: ["English"]]
```

I also have to remember that instantiating an enum using a `rawValue` produces an optional, no compile time safety there.
