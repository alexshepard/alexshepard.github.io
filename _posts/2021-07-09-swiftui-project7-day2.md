I'm dragging today, couldn't sleep at all last night. At some point I got up to get a glass of water and realized I was having [migraine aura](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-with-aura/multimedia/migraine-aura/vid-20084707). I didn't have much headache, but some tightness and lots of visual artifacts. I finally got to bed around 5am and took a sick day.

Enough whining though, I finished another day of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) this afternoon. While working through the iExpense project, I stumbled across mention of another property wrapper that could be used to automatically sync a value with UserDefaults: `@AppStorage`. I want to explore that soon, since it could take a lot of the boilerplate out of wrapping a value in UserDefaults for state observation.
