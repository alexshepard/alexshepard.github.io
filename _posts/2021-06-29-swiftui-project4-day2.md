You guessed it, more [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) today.

Today was pretty simple, adding the CoreML model to the BetterRest app and wiring it up to the UI. It was the first time I've added a non-image based CoreML model to an iOS app, but it was still really straightforward.

I'm gonna spend the rest of my hour today watching [Paul's intro to Create ML video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a905KIBw1hs). I have an idea for object segmentation that might help iNat, and I think I want to prototype it with Create ML.
