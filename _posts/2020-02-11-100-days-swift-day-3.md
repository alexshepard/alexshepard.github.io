Onward to day 3 of [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100)!

Just a few tidbits today. First of all, I'd forgotten about the `fallthrough` keyword in a `switch` statement. I guess I understand the intent here, people forget to use `break` all the time. However, it seems like every other language's `switch` statement uses the less safe but more consistent behavior of falling through unless you use `break`. If your implementation is technically safer but differs from every other implementation in the world, is it really better? On the other hand, "...because that's how it's always been done" is a crap answer to the legitimate question "why is every `switch`Â statement in the programming world so error prone?"

I'd also forgotten about the very convenient range operators in Swift.

```swift
let newbieObsRange = 0..<10
let journeyObsRange = 10..<1000
let powerUserRange = 1000...9000

switch userObsCount {
case newbieObsRange:
	print("Welcome!")
case journeyObsRange:
	print("Welcome back!")
case powerUserRange:
	print("Hey there big observer!")
default:
	print("It's over 9000!")
}
```

Finally, I noticed an annoyance with the Swift Playgrounds app on my iPad. Why does the text editor not know how to indent a `switch` statement?
