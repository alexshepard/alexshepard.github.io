One more [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) done today. Cool to see accessibility treated in 100 Days of SwiftUI, but I wonder if treating it as an afterthought is really the best approach.

Today's image is another moire sketch, from the [Generative Design book](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/).
