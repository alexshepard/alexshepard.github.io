Welp, today was not much easier than yesterday. When this heartburn hits it's pretty bad, I think it results in acid burns to my esophagus. It makes for a terrible few days until it all heals up. In the meantime it's just painful. I kept up with [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) though, and I did some more work on my SwiftUI iNat prototype. 

A few new things today, I hadn't setup unique constraints in Core Data in a long time so that was a nice refresher, and I don't remember the last time I configured a `moc`'s merge policy. I guess lately I've been using Realm more than Core Data.

I tackled another generative art sketch from the [Generative Design](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/) book this afternoon. Swift helpers for `CGRect` like `.offsetBy()` and `.midX` are really coming in handy.
