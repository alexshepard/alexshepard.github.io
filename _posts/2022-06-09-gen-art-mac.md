OK, back at the generative art stuff, working in Xcode 14 beta for MacOS. Very fun to be making SwiftUI apps with Canvas again. I'm also up to day 33 on [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) again, animations. And I'm getting back into the Japanese grind, 日本語 yay.

Here's a bit of a glitch from my attempts at doing the Color Spectrum in a Grid sketch from [Generative Design book](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/) with Canvas and SwiftUI for Mac.
