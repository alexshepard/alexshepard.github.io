Work was a little crazy today, but I was able to sneak in a bit of work on [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

What was new today? I wasn't aware of `Spacer`'s `minLength:` parameter which could be useful. And while not related to SwiftUI, the `first(where:)` method on `Array` was cool to learn.

Nothing else to report. If I've got the energy, I'll start another generative art sketch before bed.
