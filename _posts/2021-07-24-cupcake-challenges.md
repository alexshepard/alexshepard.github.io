I got a tad more [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) done today, and did some more exciting work on my explorations with the [Generative Design](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/) book in SwiftUI.

Once again the challenges were quite easy - perhaps I've already done enough Swift or SwiftUI, or perhaps I've used Codable a lot already. Or maybe Paul is keeping it simple so that we can build up some confidence. At any rate, the challenges were a breeze. The approach of wrapping struct with an `ObservableObject` to make `Codable` compliance on the struct simpler was fun to implement.

As far as the generative art stuff, I got a lot further in understanding 2d drawing with today's sketch, aligning many copies of an SF Symbol shape in a grid and using the touch location to scale and rotate each symbol.
