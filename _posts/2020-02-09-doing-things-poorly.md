In the spirit of 2020 being a kick-ass year for me, I've decided to re-start this blog. 

Expect a lot of garbage: daily posts on (re-)learning swift development, regular flailing away at machine learning stuff, and other explorations in my personal or work interests.

I recently watched [Olivia Remes' Excellent TedX talk on anxiety](https://www.ted.com/talks/olivia_remes_how_to_cope_with_anxiety?language=en) and it really hit home for me. So I'm going to try to remind myself to show up even when my work isn't any good. Hopefully that helps me deal with my anxiety and imposter syndrome, and maybe helps other people learn from watching my genuine struggles.
