One more day of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) done. We're moving into fun and new territory for me. I got my start programming as a kid when I wanted to draw using code in Basic on my Apple //c. I never really got the hang of vector drawing back then, instead sticking to the ANSI drawing system to draw pirate ships and make basic games. Making up for lost time!

Today we covered some basics, including that a `Path` is just a view and thus can be drawn directly into the view hierarchy. I guess I have some exploring to do, to learn when to draw with the new `Canvas` view in the beta, and when to just draw a `Path` directly into the view hierarchy. There's a WWDC video that I'll be watching this afternoon that hopefully provides some insight [Add rich graphics to your SwiftUI app](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10021/).
